**üìñ Project Description**

Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor is a web-based application that enables multiple users to edit and collaborate on the same document simultaneously. It is built using a full-stack JavaScript framework and utilizes real-time WebSocket communication to ensure seamless document synchronization across all connected clients.

The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js, which handle the server-side logic and route management. Real-time communication is achieved through Socket.IO, a widely-used WebSocket library that facilitates low-latency, bidirectional communication between the server and the clients. This enables live updates, where each user's changes are reflected instantly for all other users within the same session.

On the frontend, the application integrates Quill.js, an open-source rich-text editor that supports various formatting options such as bold, italic, underline, bullet lists, and headings. Quill.js is chosen for its clean API, extensibility, and efficient delta-based update model, making it highly suitable for collaborative applications.

Each document session is uniquely identified by a document ID embedded in the URL. For example, accessing a route like /document/abc123 will open a shared session corresponding to the document ID abc123. This session-based routing allows multiple users to join the same document for real-time collaboration, or to create entirely separate sessions for independent documents.

This project is designed to be lightweight and modular, making it ideal as a learning tool or a base for further development. Currently, it uses in-memory storage, meaning that the content is lost when the server restarts. However, the system architecture allows for easy integration with persistent storage systems such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or Firebase to support features like autosave, version history, and user access control.

The editor can be deployed on cloud platforms such as Heroku, Vercel, or Render. It does not currently implement authentication or encryption, but security features such as HTTPS, JWT-based authentication, and access management can be added as needed for production-ready deployments.

The project showcases essential concepts in full-stack web development and real-time systems, including:

Real-time communication using WebSockets

Client-server synchronization

Modular frontend-backend integration

Use of open-source libraries like Quill.js and Socket.IO

Stateless routing and dynamic session management

Deployment readiness for modern cloud platforms

This project serves as a strong foundation for developers interested in building collaborative platforms, such as team productivity tools, classroom learning environments, or document workflow systems. It also provides practical experience in designing and implementing real-time features, which are increasingly in demand across web applications today.

By extending this system with authentication, database integration, document storage, and collaboration features like commenting or change tracking, the application can be scaled into a production-ready collaborative tool.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-collaborative-document-editor.git
cd real-time-collaborative-document-editor
```

### Install Dependencies

## üåê Accessing the App

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:  
üëâ http://localhost:3000

You‚Äôll be automatically redirected to a unique document session like:  
http://localhost:3000/document/abc123xyz

You can share this link with others to collaborate in real-time on the same document.
